# Weather-App

Developed a dynamic Weather App using JavaScript, CSS, and the OpenWeather API. The app provides real-time weather updates for the user's current location and includes a search option for any place. Leveraging JavaScript DOM manipulation, it offers an interactive interface displaying weather conditions, temperature, and more.
